Using clearly labeled headers and sub-headers if necessary, outline the major sections, as described in the assignment handout.

## A few tips:
1 . To make simple tables (preferable to screenshots for smaller tables), use the following syntax:

| header 1 | header 2 | header 3 |
| ------- | ------- |------- |
| x | | y | z | 

2. To keep your code from displaying in your markdown, use `echo = FALSE` in your code chunk like as follows:
```{r, echo = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
x = 2 + 3
# calling x will ensure it is printed into the knit pdf but the code isn't displayed
print(x)
```
