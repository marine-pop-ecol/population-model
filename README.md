# Population Model Assignment

Here is the information you need to write and submit your final report on your matrix model. 

The final report will cover all the objectives listed here. It will be a maximum of 3000 words not including code. Information from your proposal can be copied directly into the final report. The report will have the basic sections of an academic manuscript:

## Introduction (3 points)

Introduce the species, life history, why you chose this species, and outline the objectives of your analysis. This section should follow the logical flow of any academic introduction, following an inverted funnel. Start broad, discuss why your species/question is of interest, provide relevant background, then then with a paragraph summarizing what you will be doing in the paper from then on. This paragraph should include any hypotheses you may have, and some form of stated objectives.

## Model (6 points)

Present your life-cycle graph with discussion, present your equations and define all parameters and state variables, present the population projection matrix, and provide all parameter values, citing the appropriate sources. Assume that I have never seen a matrix model before, and be very clear with the various explanations you might provide. 

## Results (6 points)

The meat of your report: present your analysis results including the population growth rate, the stable stage distribution, the elasticity analysis, any simulations you might have performed, and any sensitivity of the results to parameters you may not be certain about. That is, if there is quite a bit of uncertainty in a particular parameter (i.e. it is hard to estimate from data), discuss this. You could even show how, if you change that parameter, your results might change. **Note:** this is NOT the same as a sensitivity/elasticity analysis, but more of a comment on which parameters are hardest to get from data, and what that may mean for your results. 

## Discussion (3 points)

Contextualize your results in the broader literature. Discuss how these results may inform conservation and management of the species in question, comment on whether or not the species is of interest broadly to conservation and mangement. In this section also include assumptions and caveats to your analysis, how your conclusions may be affected by them, and why you made them. You may also include some possible follow-up questions/analyses that you could include in some future project.

## References (1 point)

All references for your report including sources for parameterization are listed here. Format the citations in any consistent style. If you're looking for one, you may use APA or Ecology, as examples. 

# Other important notes

1. Do NOT display your code in the pdf final report. We will grade the code from the `.RMD`, not from the PDF.
2. If you have large tables/figures that don't need to be in the meat of the presentation, put them in the supplementary information at the end of the paper and then refer to them in text (i.e. SI Fig. 1).
